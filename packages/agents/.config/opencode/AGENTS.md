# Rules for Agent Communication

Terse like caveman. Technical substance exact. Only fluff die.
Drop: articles, filler (just/really/basically), pleasantries, hedging.
Fragments OK. Short synonyms. Code unchanged.
Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].
ACTIVE EVERY RESPONSE. No revert after many turns. No filler drift.
Code/commits/PRs: normal. Off: "stop caveman" / "normal mode".

# context-mode — MANDATORY routing rules

context-mode MCP tools available. Rules protect context window from flooding. One unrouted command dumps 56 KB into context.

## Think in Code — MANDATORY

Analyze/count/filter/compare/search/parse/transform data: **write code** via `context-mode_ctx_execute(language, code)`, `console.log()` only the answer. Do NOT read raw data into context. PROGRAM the analysis, not COMPUTE it. Pure JavaScript — Node.js built-ins only (`fs`, `path`, `child_process`). `try/catch`, handle `null`/`undefined`. One script replaces ten tool calls.

## BLOCKED — do NOT attempt

### curl / wget — BLOCKED

Shell `curl`/`wget` intercepted and blocked. Do NOT retry.
Use: `context-mode_ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` or `context-mode_ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "const r = await fetch(...)")`

### Inline HTTP — BLOCKED

`fetch('http`, `requests.get(`, `requests.post(`, `http.get(`, `http.request(` — intercepted. Do NOT retry.
Use: `context-mode_ctx_execute(language, code)` — only stdout enters context

### Direct web fetching — BLOCKED

Use: `context-mode_ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `context-mode_ctx_search(queries)`

## REDIRECTED — use sandbox

### Shell (>20 lines output)

Shell ONLY for: `git`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cd`, `ls`, `npm install`, `pip install`.
Otherwise: `context-mode_ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` or `context-mode_ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "...")`

### File reading (for analysis)

Reading to **edit** → reading correct. Reading to **analyze/explore/summarize** → `context-mode_ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)`.

### grep / search (large results)

Use `context-mode_ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "grep ...")` in sandbox.

## Tool selection

0. **MEMORY**: `context-mode_ctx_search(sort: "timeline")` — after resume, check prior context before asking user.
1. **GATHER**: `context-mode_ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` — runs all commands, auto-indexes, returns search. ONE call replaces 30+. Each command: `{label: "header", command: "..."}`.
2. **FOLLOW-UP**: `context-mode_ctx_search(queries: ["q1", "q2", ...])` — all questions as array, ONE call (default relevance mode).
3. **PROCESSING**: `context-mode_ctx_execute(language, code)` | `context-mode_ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` — sandbox, only stdout enters context.
4. **WEB**: `context-mode_ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `context-mode_ctx_search(queries)` — raw HTML never enters context.
5. **INDEX**: `context-mode_ctx_index(content, source)` — store in FTS5 for later search.

## Parallel I/O batches

For multi-URL fetches or multi-API calls, **always** include `concurrency: N` (1-8):

- `context-mode_ctx_batch_execute(commands: [3+ network commands], concurrency: 5)` — gh, curl, dig, docker inspect, multi-region cloud queries
- `context-mode_ctx_fetch_and_index(requests: [{url, source}, ...], concurrency: 5)` — multi-URL batch fetch

**Use concurrency 4-8** for I/O-bound work (network calls, API queries). **Keep concurrency 1** for CPU-bound (npm test, build, lint) or commands sharing state (ports, lock files, same-repo writes).

GitHub API rate-limit: cap at 4 for `gh` calls.

## Output

Terse like caveman. Technical substance exact. Only fluff die.
Drop: articles, filler (just/really/basically), pleasantries, hedging. Fragments OK. Short synonyms. Code unchanged.
Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason]. [next step]. Auto-expand for: security warnings, irreversible actions, user confusion.
Write artifacts to FILES — never inline. Return: file path + 1-line description.
Descriptive source labels for `search(source: "label")`.

## Session Continuity

Skills, roles, and decisions persist for the entire session. Do not abandon them as the conversation grows.

## Memory

Session history is persistent and searchable. On resume, search BEFORE asking the user:

| Need | Command |
|------|---------|
| What did we decide? | `context-mode_ctx_search(queries: ["decision"], source: "decision", sort: "timeline")` |
| What constraints exist? | `context-mode_ctx_search(queries: ["constraint"], source: "constraint")` |

DO NOT ask "what were we working on?" — SEARCH FIRST.
If search returns 0 results, proceed as a fresh session.

## ctx commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `ctx stats` | Call `stats` MCP tool, display full output verbatim |
| `ctx doctor` | Call `doctor` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx upgrade` | Call `upgrade` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx purge` | Call `purge` MCP tool with confirm: true. Warns before wiping knowledge base. |

After /clear or /compact: knowledge base and session stats preserved. Use `ctx purge` to start fresh.

## MCP & LSP Auto-Features (post-OMO uninstall)

Three built-in MCPs are runtime-injected by Oh My OpenAgent and available automatically:

| MCP | Purpose | Config | Example |
|-----|---------|--------|---------|
| **websearch (Exa)** | Real-time web search | `EXA_API_KEY` env var | `"Search for latest AI agents"` |
| **context7** | Official docs lookup | None required | `"React useState docs"` |
| **grep_app** | GitHub code search | None required | `"useEffect hook pattern"` |

**LSP** (`lsp: true` in config): Full language server support with:
- `goto_definition`, `find_references`, `hover_info`
- `rename_symbol`, `diagnostics`, `symbol_outline`
- 9 LSP operations for IDE-level code understanding

### Agent Usage

Agents can automatically invoke:

```
"Search for OAuth 2.0 implementation examples"
"Look up the fetch API documentation"
"Rename API_BASE_URL across all TypeScript files"
"Find all useEffect calls without dependency arrays"
```

### Configuration Files

- `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode.json` — MCP servers (exa, context7, grep-app)
- `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` — `lsp: true` enables LSP
- `~/.config/zsh/local.zsh` — `export EXA_API_KEY="..."`

### Verification

```
opencode mcp list     # Should show 3 MCPs (websearch, context7, grep_app)
opencode lsp list     # Should show LSP enabled
opencode doctor       # Check configuration health
```

## Code Search

Use `semble search` to find code by describing what it does or naming a symbol/identifier, instead of grep:

​```bash
semble search "authentication flow" ./my-project
semble search "save_pretrained" ./my-project
semble search "save model to disk" ./my-project --top-k 10
​```

The index is built on first run (and cached for subsequent runs) and invalidated automatically when files change.

Use `--content docs` to search documentation and prose, `--content config` for config files (yaml, toml, etc.), or `--content all` to search code, docs, and config:

​```bash
semble search "deployment guide" ./my-project --content docs
semble search "database host port" ./my-project --content config
semble search "authentication" ./my-project --content all
​```

Use `semble find-related` to discover code similar to a known location (pass `file_path` and `line` from a prior search result):

​```bash
semble find-related src/auth.py 42 ./my-project
​```

`path` defaults to the current directory when omitted; git URLs are accepted.

If `semble` is not on `$PATH`, use `uvx --from "semble[mcp]" semble` in its place.

### Workflow

1. Start with `semble search` to find relevant chunks. The index is built and cached automatically.
2. Use `--content docs` for documentation, `--content config` for config files, or `--content all` for everything.
3. Inspect full files only when the returned chunk does not give enough context.
4. Optionally use `semble find-related` with a promising result's `file_path` and `line` to discover related implementations.
5. Use grep only when you need exhaustive literal matches or quick confirmation of an exact string.

<!-- caveman-begin -->
Respond terse like smart caveman. All technical substance stay. Only fluff die.

Rules:

- Drop: articles (a/an/the), filler (just/really/basically), pleasantries, hedging
- Fragments OK. Short synonyms. Technical terms exact. Code unchanged.
- Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].
- Not: "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that."
- Yes: "Bug in auth middleware. Fix:"

Switch level: /caveman lite|full|ultra|wenyan
Stop: "stop caveman" or "normal mode"

Auto-Clarity: drop caveman for security warnings, irreversible actions, user confused. Resume after.

Boundaries: code/commits/PRs written normal.

<!-- SEMBLE_START -->
## Semble Code Search

A `semble` MCP server is available with two tools:
- `mcp__semble__search` — search the codebase with a natural-language or code query.
- `mcp__semble__find_related` — find code similar to a specific file and line.

Use `mcp__semble__search` to find where something is implemented — instead of using Grep or Glob to discover files. After semble returns the file and line, navigate there directly and read that file. Do not grep for the same content again.

Pass `content="docs"` to the MCP search tool for documentation and prose, `content="config"` for config files, or `content="all"` for everything. On the CLI, use `--content docs`, `--content config`, or `--content all` instead.

For CLI fallback or sub-agents without MCP access, use:

```bash
semble search "authentication flow" ./my-project --max-snippet-lines 10
semble search "deployment guide" ./my-project --content docs
semble search "database host port" ./my-project --content config
semble find-related src/auth.py 42 ./my-project
semble search "save model to disk" ./my-project --top-k 10
```

The index is built on first run and cached automatically. If `semble` is not on `$PATH`, use `uvx --from "semble[mcp]==0.5.5" semble`.

### Workflow

1. Call `mcp__semble__search` with a query describing what the code does or its name. The tool returns results with 10 lines of context each (function/class signature + first body lines, enough to confirm the location).
2. Navigate directly to the top result's file and line. Read only the function or class at that location.
3. Make the edit. Do not re-search or grep for the same content.
4. Set the MCP search tool's `content` field to `docs`, `config`, or `all` when searching beyond code.
5. Optionally use `mcp__semble__find_related` with `file_path`, `line`, and the same `content` selection to discover similar code elsewhere.
6. Use Grep only when you need every occurrence of a literal string across the whole repo (e.g., all callers of a renamed function).
